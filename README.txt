PA07\
\
For this PA07, I used the three classes, FamilyInfo, Person and Relatives.java. I had to use Relatives for the client code that does i/o so that prints out with the algorithm of brining the name of ancestors and descendants. The Person class is needed to call the method of the name that it needs to because for each of the method in Relative class, they need to have the name typed in as a parameter also for the FamilyInfo class. In the FamilyInfo class,  this class is needed have the names to be processed. The FamilyInfo class is crucial because they will decide who is the mother, father and children. }
